## Synopsis
<p align="justify">
    7 Up 7 Down is a classic party game and I am sure we all must have played it at some point in our life. Just to brief up, in this game two dices are thrown and one has to guess the sum of 2  dices. He can choose if the sum will be more then 7 (7 Up), or if the sum will be less then 7 (7 Down), or if the sum will be equal to 7 (7) and stake money on this choice. Depending on the outcome, he will win or loose. 
    <br /><br />
    In this version (2.0) of the game, we have allowed the user to play as many games as they want and also give them the freedom to quit whenever they want to. We have also added functionality to display scores of wins and losses after every game to the user.

<!-- Coding Language used in this project -->
## Coding Language
Coding language in which the solution are provided here is:
- **Python**

<!-- Libraries I have used in this project -->
## Libraries
- *random* - this library is imported and we have used a function randint() which returns a random number between 1st and 2nd parameter

    ```python
    from random import randint

    random_number = random.randint(1, 6)  # to get random number between 1 and 6
    ```

<!-- Concept that will be tested in this project -->
## Concepts
- **OOPs**
  - Created a class called *Dice* that creates a random number between 1 and 6 for a dice and has its string representation set to the random number generated. 

  - Created a class called *People* that hold result of every dame for a user.

- **Functions** - To make use of code and refrain from writing same code again and again.
